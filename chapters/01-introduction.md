# Chapter 1
## Introduction — From Management to AI Agent Management

**This is a management book for the agent era.** It keeps the tone and practicality of *8 Things to Know for New Tech Leaders* and updates it with the systems you need to **design, deploy, and manage AI agents**—without losing accountability.

The principles haven't changed: you still need to care deeply about people, understand business value, maintain quality, and build trust. What's changed is the **magnitude** and the **tools**. With agents, you can amplify your impact—but only if you understand the operating system.

---

## What This Book Delivers

### An Operating System for the Agent Era
- **Outcome Ownership**: Humans own outcomes; agents may do work, but humans sign off.
- **HITL (Human in the Loop)**: Gates, escalations, and rollback at every autonomy level.
- **Context Packs**: Right-sized, fresh knowledge that agents (and humans) need to deliver.
- **Autonomy Ladders**: Four levels from Draft-only to Metric-Auto, with promotion criteria.
- **Agent Scorecards**: Universal metrics—Tokens per Task, Autonomous Accept Rate, Escalation Rate, Correction Rate, Cost per Outcome.

### Playbooks for Culture, Balance, Care, and Autonomy
The original book emphasized **people first**. That hasn't changed. With agents, you're managing **humans and artificial agents**, but the philosophy is identical: clear goals, relevant context, access to support, and guidance with autonomy.

You'll learn:
- How to prioritize life (for yourself and your team) when agents handle mindless work.
- How to show care—for people and systems—by building trust through consistent, evidence-based decisions.
- How to apply **Inversion of Control** to empower both teams and agents.

### Execution Styles Mapped to Agent Portfolios
Not everyone works the same way. The book introduced three execution styles: **Prototyper**, **Productizer**, and **Scaler**. These styles apply to humans *and* to how you structure your agent portfolios:
- **Prototypers** use agents for rapid iteration and learning signal.
- **Productizers** use agents to expand capability—more features, more value, more users.
- **Scalers** use agents to reduce cost and complexity while increasing reliability.

### Business Model, OKRs, KPIs, and Cross-Team Contracts Reframed for Agents
Agents don't change **what** you measure—they change **how** you deliver and what becomes possible. You'll learn:
- **Unit economics** with agents: Cost per Outcome, AOPD (Accepted Outcomes per Dollar).
- **OKRs** with agent-backed KRs: company-level OKRs stay tool-agnostic; division/team OKRs surface agent-backed work with **AgentOps** sheets.
- **KPIs and North Star**: Agents must be measured on **accepted outcomes**, not raw outputs.
- **Cross-team collaboration**: Producer/consumer contracts, interfaces, and Context Packs.

## The Promise

You'll ship faster, with **higher quality**, and **lower cost per accepted outcome**—while keeping humans in charge of outcomes and taste.

Agents execute. Humans curate and guarantee.

## Why Now? Why You?

### The Moment We're In

Software is eating the world, and AI agents are eating software development. If you're an engineering manager, team lead, Staff/Principal engineer, PM, or program manager, you're already feeling the shift. Agents can draft PRs, triage bugs, generate docs, run evals, and even propose architecture changes.

But here's the paradox: **the better agents get at execution, the more critical management becomes.**

Why? Because someone has to:
- Decide what "good" looks like (acceptance tests, taste, rubrics).
- Own the outcome when an agent gets it wrong.
- Maintain **Context Packs** so agents have the right knowledge.
- Graduate agents through autonomy levels—or demote them when they drift.
- Balance cost, latency, safety, and quality in a portfolio.

That someone is **you**.

### Your Edge: A Decade of Management Experience

If you've managed teams, shipped products, handled incidents, made hard trade-offs, and earned trust, you have a **massive advantage**. The skills you've built—outcome thinking, taste, decision-making under uncertainty, care for people, understanding of business value—are exactly what the agent era demands.

Agents amplify those skills. They don't replace them.

### The Business Case (What Your CFO Cares About)

Let's be blunt: agents are here because they change the unit economics of software.

In the original *8 Things to Know for New Tech Leaders*, I emphasized **knowing the business**—understanding how engineering work ties to revenue, margins, and strategic goals. That lesson is even more critical now.

With agents, you can measure:
- **Cost per Outcome**: Total cost (inference + context + tools + evals + ops) divided by accepted outcomes.
- **Cost Savings vs. Baseline**: What you're no longer spending on human execution.
- **AOPD (Accepted Outcomes per Dollar)**: The North Star for portfolio performance.

Your CFO will ask: "Are agents making us more efficient?" You need to answer with data, not vibes.

### The People Case (What Your Team Cares About)

Your team doesn't want to be replaced. They want to **stop doing mindless work** and focus on craft, creativity, and impact.

Agents handle:
- Repetitive scaffolding and boilerplate.
- Routine triage and classification.
- Doc generation and formatting.
- Low-risk PR generation within guardrails.

Humans focus on:
- Defining acceptance and taste.
- Designing systems and making trade-offs.
- Incident response and high-stakes decisions.
- Mentoring, critique, and culture.

**Your job is to ensure agents amplify your team, not threaten them.**

## How to Read This Book

### If You're New to Management
Start with **Part I: Foundation** (Chapters 1–5). These establish the mindset: Outcome Ownership, life balance, trust, and care. Even if you're not managing humans yet, you'll be managing agents—and the principles are the same.

Then move to **Part II: The Agent Operating System** (Chapters 6–8): Inversion of Control, T-shaped agents, and AgentOps. These chapters are the infrastructure you need before anything else.

### If You're an Experienced Manager New to Agents
Start with **Chapter 3: Outcome Ownership**, then **Chapter 6: Inversion of Control**, and **Chapter 8: AgentOps**. These three chapters will ground you in the operating model.

Then jump to **Part IV: Execution** (Chapters 12–18) for the tactical playbooks: OKRs, metrics, P→P→S, meetings, and launch.

### If You're Already Running Agent Portfolios
Skim Part I for philosophical alignment, then focus on **Chapters 8–14** (AgentOps, Progression, Metrics, OKRs). Use the **Appendices** as drop-in templates for your registry, scorecards, and Context Packs.

### Use the Templates and Bonus Pack
Throughout the book, you'll find inline templates in YAML and Markdown. Use them. Adapt them. The **Appendices** expand on these with full usage guides, examples, and checklists:
- **Appendix A**: Agent Scorecard Template
- **Appendix B**: Registry Entry & MCP Integration
- **Appendix C**: OKR Examples (Company → Division → Team → Agent)
- **Appendix D**: P→P→S Checklist
- **Appendix E**: JIRA & Tooling Setup (Classic Reference)

## What You'll Need (Optional: For Local AgentOps Setup)

**The key to this book is understanding the concepts—outcome ownership, measurement, and trust.** These management principles apply whether you're using a managed agent platform or building your own infrastructure.

**The technical setup below is only necessary if you're deploying AgentOps locally.** Many teams use existing platforms (cloud providers, agent services, or internal tools). If that's you, the frameworks in this book still apply—you'll just focus on what to measure and how to manage, not on infrastructure.

**If you are setting up agents locally**, you'll need:

1. **A code/doc repo** for Context Packs, Design Briefs, and Eval harnesses.
2. **A dashboard** to track tokens per task, autonomous accept rate, escalation/correction rates, and Cost per Outcome.
3. **A decision log** (append-only) to record what you decided and why.
4. **A registry** (YAML, JSON, or DB) to track agents, versions, owners, and scopes.
5. **CI integration** for evals and policy tests.

Don't worry—we'll cover how to set these up in **Chapter 8: AgentOps** and reference implementations in the appendices. But remember: **the setup is optional. The concepts are universal.**

## The Original Foundation: Knowing the Business

Before we dive into agent-specific tactics, let's revisit a principle from the original book: **you must know the business**.

### Why Engineering Exists

Engineering teams exist to create **business value**. That value can be:
- **Revenue growth**: new features that attract customers or increase spend.
- **Cost reduction**: automation, efficiency, or reduced support load.
- **Risk mitigation**: security, compliance, reliability.
- **Strategic positioning**: capabilities that unlock new markets or defensibility.

If you can't connect your team's work to one of these, you're either working on the wrong things or not communicating well.

### Value Vocabulary

To lead effectively, you need to speak the language of value:
- **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue): the lifeblood of SaaS businesses.
- **NRR** (Net Revenue Retention): are customers expanding or churning?
- **Gross Margin**: revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). Engineering work that improves margin is highly valued.
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): how much does it cost to acquire a customer? Can engineering reduce this?
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value): how much revenue does a customer generate over their lifetime?

### Agents and Unit Economics

Here's where agents change the game: they can dramatically improve **unit economics** for software delivery.

Let's say your team ships 100 PRs per quarter. Each PR takes a human ~4 hours (research, coding, testing, review). That's 400 hours, or ~$40,000 in fully-loaded cost.

Now introduce a PR Copilot agent (Autonomy Level 2: Suggest-PR):
- The agent drafts PRs in minutes.
- Humans review and merge in ~30 minutes per PR.
- 100 PRs now take ~50 hours, or ~$5,000 in human cost, plus $500 in agent inference costs.

**Result**: $34,500 saved per quarter, plus faster cycle time.

Your CFO sees this as **margin expansion**. Your team sees this as **less grunt work**. Your customers see this as **faster feature delivery**.

**This is why you need to understand the business.** Agents aren't just a technical curiosity—they're a strategic lever.
