**About This Edition**

This book builds on *8 Things to Know for New Tech Leaders* (2021), updated for the AI agent era. The principles of effective leadership remain—Outcome Ownership, trust, care, and craft—but the tools have changed. Agents are force multipliers, and this edition shows you how to manage them alongside your human teams.
