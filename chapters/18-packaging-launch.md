# Chapter 18
## Packaging & Launch

This final chapter is meta—it's about how this book itself reaches you. If you're reading this, the packaging and launch worked.

---

## Title & Subtitle

**Agents — From Management to AI Agent Management**

**Tagline:** Outcome Ownership in the Age of AI Agents.

---

## What This Book Is

A field guide for product and engineering leaders who want to turn AI agents into **trusted operators**—using **Outcome Ownership**, **HITL**, **autonomy ladders**, and **Agent Scorecards**—so your org ships faster **without** amplifying mistakes.

---

## Who This Book Is For

- Engineering Managers (EM)
- Product Managers (PM)
- Tech Leads (TL)
- Staff/Principal Engineers
- Program Managers
- Directors/VPs of Engineering or Product
- Founders building software with small, senior teams

**The common thread**: You're in the delivery layer. You know that leveraging agents is really about **managing** them—and that classic engineering management skills transfer directly.

---

## What's Inside

- Rapid shifts since 2024: what changed (RAG, vectors) and what **stayed true**
- Culture as the OS: **Outcome Ownership**, taste, craft
- Balance without burnout: escalation design, quiet hours, rituals
- IoC for agents: **Context Packs** and autonomy ladders
- **T-shaped humans and agents**; producer/consumer mapping
- Flattened progression: scope & guarantees for people; autonomy for agents
- Three execution styles: **Prototyper**, **Productizer**, **Scaler**
- Business model, pricing by outcome, and a 30-60-90 tune-up
- OKRs that hide the machinery; **Agent Scorecards** that don't
- P→P→S as an evidence pipeline; **artifacts over meetings**
- Cross-team federation: **contracts, not vibes**
- **AgentOps**: registry, HITL, evals, dashboards—discipline over tools

## Amazon Description (Long Form)

Leaders are waking up to a simple truth: **AI agents don't remove accountability — they amplify it.**

This book is a field guide for **product and engineering leaders** who want to turn today's hype into **reliable outcomes**. It reframes classic management for the agent era: **Outcome Ownership**, **HITL**, **IoC (servant leadership)**, **Context Packs**, **autonomy ladders**, **Agent Scorecards**, **OKRs that stay tool-agnostic**, and **Business Model Canvas** wired to **Cost per Outcome**.

Inside, you'll get a practical operating system:

- Make **humans own outcomes**, agents do the busywork.
- Design **agent portfolios** for your stage: Prototyper, Productizer, Scaler.
- Shift from meetings to **artifacts**: P→P→S, decision logs, C4 diagrams, runbooks.
- Run **AgentOps**: registry, HITL, eval harness, promotion/demotion by evidence.
- Track what matters: **tokens per task, autonomous accept rate, escalation/correction rates**, cost/latency/safety/drift.
- Price and package by **outcome**, not tokens; show **cost savings** instead of "AI magic."

Whether you're an EM, PM, TL, Staff/Principal, or a founder building software with a small, senior team—this book helps you **manage agents like top performers** and **ship with taste**.

**Ideal reader:** Anyone in the delivery layer (EM/PM/Program) who knows that leveraging agents is really about **managing** them—and that classic engineering management skills transfer directly.
