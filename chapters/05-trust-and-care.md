# Chapter 5
## Trust & Care — For People and Systems

---

The best indicator of a great working environment is when everyone understands that their team has their back, especially their boss. So much energy is wasted in organizations when the level of trust is not where it should be.

As leaders, the decisions we make are much louder than any words we speak. The great work environment starts from us.

In the agent era, **trust extends to systems**. You must trust your team, and your team must trust the agents they work with. Both require the same foundation: **consistency, transparency, and evidence-based decisions**.

---

## Trust Is Earned Through Actions

It is very easy to speak about the benefits of teamwork and trust, but when the actions do not follow suit, the words can be very empty.

Trusting can be difficult, but it is the only way to scale an organization. If you cannot trust others with what they are responsible for, you will be forced to spend energy worrying about the details, preventing you from doing your own work well.

**Trust is also a very personal thing.** We choose who we trust, and others choose who they trust. There is very little anyone can do to force trust on others. The only path to building trust is a long and consistent road of sprinkling actions that build trust in others.

---

## To Build Trust, You Must Trust First

There will be many times when a negative outcome occurs from too much trust, but that is a **much lower price to pay** than to remove trust from all future encounters.

### The Red Tape Problem

How this plays out in organizations is one of the biggest reasons large companies fail to compete with smaller companies. Large organizations, through past encounters, lose trust and place restrictive processes (red tape) into place. This takes away from the flexibility of future teams and prevents them from ever reaching their optimal.

Large organizations will be much more difficult to influence and change as a whole, but we can still choose the foundational values for how we build and grow our teams.

### Micromanagement Is a Trust Signal

Micromanagement is a clear indicator of a team that is lacking trust. When leaders micromanage, that action will be subconsciously interpreted as a lack of trust.

This is true even when the employee is junior. Junior employees need additional guidance and oversight, but they should still be empowered to make the decisions they are ready and expected to make. If someone is given a responsibility, working with them to improve their understanding and execution is always a better route to take.

## Trust in the Agent Era

In the agent era, you need to build trust in **two directions**:
1. **Humans trusting agents**: Will this agent deliver? Will it escalate when it should? Will it stay within boundaries?
2. **Agents as trust amplifiers**: When humans trust agents to handle routine work, they have more time to build trust with each other.

### How Humans Trust Agents

Humans trust agents through **evidence**:
- **Eval pass rates**: ≥ 95% on golden datasets.
- **Autonomous Accept Rate (AAR)**: ≥ 80% for L2/L3 agents.
- **Escalation behavior**: Agent escalates when it should (not too often, not too rarely).
- **Rollback reliability**: When something goes wrong, rollback works.
- **Observability**: Traces, dashboards, and scorecards show what the agent is doing.

**You can't build trust in an agent with vibes.** You need data.

### How Agents Amplify Trust

When an agent reliably handles routine tasks, humans have more time for:
- **Deep work**: Designing, mentoring, critiquing.
- **Human connection**: 1:1s, pairing, team-building.
- **Incident response**: Clear-headed problem-solving instead of constant triage fatigue.

**Result**: Trust among humans strengthens because they're not burned out and frustrated.

## Consistency: The Foundation of Trust

As we trust the ones we manage, trust will be easier to be reciprocated. The need for teams to have trust in leaders and managers is significant. The only way to build that trust is to be **consistent in the way decisions are made**.

### What Consistency Looks Like

- **Predictable decision-making**: If you promote someone, others should understand why based on past decisions.
- **Transparency**: Decision logs, OKR reviews, and portfolio reviews are visible.
- **Follow-through**: If you say you'll do something, you do it.
- **Fairness**: People are treated equitably (not equally—equity accounts for context).

### What Breaks Trust

- **Favoritism**: Promoting or rewarding based on relationships, not performance.
- **Surprise decisions**: "We're killing this project" with no warning or context.
- **Lack of follow-through**: "We'll review agent performance monthly"... and then you don't.
- **Blame without accountability**: "The agent messed up" instead of "I didn't provide the right Context Pack."

## Balancing Company Needs and Individual Growth

As leaders progress through their careers, the responsibility they have for the business increases. This added responsibility should never take away from their original responsibility of ensuring the well-being and growth of the ones reporting to them.

**That balance is what makes being an executive difficult**: the need to make hard decisions.

### When Interests Align

Most of the time, what's good for the business is good for individuals:
- Shipping great outcomes → customers happy → company grows → raises and promotions.
- Learning new skills → better execution → better outcomes → career growth.

In these cases, trust is easy to maintain.

### When Interests Diverge

Sometimes, the company needs something that's not aligned with an individual's growth:
- A project gets canceled (market shift, strategic pivot).
- A role becomes redundant (automation, agent displacement).
- A skill set is no longer critical (legacy tech sunset).

**In these cases, leaders must be transparent and supportive.**

If managers are consistent in ensuring the growth of the people in their teams, when times become difficult and hard decisions need to be made, the human element will not be lost.

### The Test of Trust

If managers and leaders are unable to make decisions that are positive for the company **and** healthy for the individual, the company may not be a sustainable business.

Leaders have to constantly make decisions that strengthen the team while strengthening the company. Specific skill sets and individuals may no longer be needed, but if the growth of our employees has been a core part of their time with us, they should be well prepared.

**It is often out of the control of leaders** what the market and business need. The surest way to provide security that employees remain valuable is to ensure that their professional growth is constant.

When leaders have to make decisions that benefit only the company and not the individual, they have to be very aware of that decision. **If it happens often, maybe this position is supposed to be contracted out.** Burning out the strategic parts of the company does not make sense.

## Showing Care Through Systems

Care isn't just about being nice. Care is about **thinking ahead** and **removing friction**.

### For Humans

**Show care by**:
- Unblocking them before they even ask.
- Providing clear goals and context.
- Removing unnecessary meetings.
- Protecting their focus time.
- Celebrating wins and learning from failures.

### For Agents

**Show care by**:
- Maintaining fresh Context Packs (don't let them work with stale knowledge).
- Running evals regularly (catch drift before it causes incidents).
- Updating runbooks when things change.
- Promoting agents when they've earned it (don't leave a high-performing agent stuck at L1).
- Retiring agents gracefully when they're no longer needed (don't let zombie agents clutter the portfolio).

**The pattern is the same**: Care means **proactive stewardship**, not reactive damage control.

---

## Trust Agents, Verify Always

"Trust but verify" is a cliché, but it's the right model for agents.

### Trust

- Give agents the autonomy they've earned (based on evals and metrics).
- Let them auto-merge within bounded scenarios.
- Allow them to escalate when uncertain (don't punish escalations).

### Verify

- **Evals in CI**: Every change to an agent or its Context Pack runs evals.
- **Dashboards**: Tokens per Task, AAR, ER, CR, CPO, Latency, Safety, Drift.
- **Audits**: Monthly reviews of agent performance and autonomy levels.
- **PIRs**: When an agent contributes to an incident, update the Context Pack and evals.

**This isn't micromanagement—it's responsible stewardship.**

## Template: Trust-Building Actions

Use this checklist to build and maintain trust:

```markdown
## Trust-Building Checklist (Weekly)

### For Your Team (Humans)
- [ ] Did I unblock anyone this week?
- [ ] Did I provide clear, consistent feedback?
- [ ] Did I follow through on commitments?
- [ ] Did I protect someone's focus time?
- [ ] Did I celebrate a win or learn from a failure?

### For Your Systems (Agents)
- [ ] Did I review agent scorecards?
- [ ] Did I update any stale Context Packs?
- [ ] Did I run evals after any config changes?
- [ ] Did I promote or demote any agents based on evidence?
- [ ] Did I log decisions in the decision log?

### For Cross-Team Trust
- [ ] Did I communicate changes that affect other teams?
- [ ] Did I honor my commitments to other teams?
- [ ] Did I escalate blockers early?
```

## The Compounding Effect of Trust

Trust compounds. When you consistently show care, make transparent decisions, and follow through, people notice. Over time:
- Your team trusts you → they take more ownership.
- You trust your team → they deliver better outcomes.
- Your team trusts agents → they leverage them more effectively.
- Agents perform reliably → everyone's productivity rises.

**The opposite also compounds.** If trust erodes, people:
- Stop taking initiative (why bother if you'll second-guess them?).
- Work around you instead of with you.
- Leave for teams where trust is stronger.

---

## Red Flags: When Trust Is Eroding

Watch for these signs:

### In Humans
- People stop speaking up in meetings.
- Passive-aggressive Slack messages.
- Work-arounds instead of direct collaboration.
- High attrition.

### In Agents
- Rising Escalation Rate (agent is uncertain, likely due to unclear goals or stale Context Packs).
- Falling Autonomous Accept Rate (agent is drifting, needs re-tuning).
- Incidents where "the agent did something weird" (signal that observability or guardrails are lacking).

**Fix these immediately.** Trust is hard to build and easy to destroy.

## Practical Example: Building Trust with a New Agent

### Scenario
You're deploying **spec-to-pr** (L1: Draft-only) for the first time. Your team is skeptical: "Will it actually help, or just create busywork?"

### How to Build Trust

**Week 1: Set Expectations**
- "This agent will draft PRs for unit tests. You review every one. We're measuring Tokens per Task and Draft Quality."
- Show the team the **Context Pack** and **evals**. Make it transparent.

**Week 2–4: Gather Evidence**
- Run the agent on 20 tasks.
- Show the team the **scorecards**: "Draft Quality ≥ 90%, saves ~30 min per task."
- Highlight where the agent did well and where it needs improvement.

**Week 5: Decide Together**
- "Based on 4 weeks of evidence, I propose promoting to L2 (Suggest-PR). Thoughts?"
- If the team agrees, promote. If not, stay at L1 and gather more evidence.

**Week 6+: Reinforce**
- Keep showing scorecards.
- When the agent saves time, celebrate it.
- When the agent drifts, fix the Context Pack and log the decision.

**Result**: The team trusts the agent because they've seen the evidence and participated in the decision.

---

## Summary

Trust is the foundation of high-performing teams—human and agent.

**Build trust by**:
- Trusting first.
- Being consistent in decisions.
- Showing care through proactive stewardship.
- Using evidence (evals, metrics, dashboards) instead of vibes.

**In the agent era, trust extends to systems.** Care for your agents the way you care for your team: clear goals, fresh context, observability, and promotion based on evidence.

**Trust compounds.** Invest in it daily, and you'll build a team—human and agent—that can ship great outcomes sustainably.
