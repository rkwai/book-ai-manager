### Who this is for
An **e‑leader** in product development—EM, team lead, Staff/Principal, **PM**, or **Program Manager**—directly responsible for outcomes and value. If your org builds software or uses PM/Eng/Design, this is you. In today’s world, **using agents is a requirement**.

### Assumptions
- You care about **business outcomes**, not output theater.
- You will **own** what agents ship; **no unreviewed agent output** reaches customers.
- You’ll adopt **AgentOps** basics: registry, evals, HITL, scorecards.

### How to read
- Start with **Culture & Outcome Ownership** (Ch.04), then **Autonomy & IoC** (Ch.07).
- Use **templates** inline (YAML/MD) and the **Bonus Pack** in `/bonus/`.
- Apply **P→P→S** (Ch.14) before introducing a new agent; wire **OKRs/KPIs** (Ch.12–13).

### What you’ll need
- A code/doc repo for **Context Packs**, **Design Briefs**, and **Eval harnesses**.
- A dashboard to track **tokens per task**, **autonomous accept rate**, **escalation/correction**, and **Cost per Outcome**.
