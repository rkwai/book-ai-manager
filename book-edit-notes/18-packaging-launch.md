# Amazon Description (Long Form)

Leaders are waking up to a simple truth: **AI agents don’t remove accountability — they amplify it.**  
This book is a field guide for **product and engineering leaders** who want to turn today’s hype into **reliable outcomes**. It reframes classic management for the agent era: **Outcome Ownership**, **HITL**, **IoC (servant leadership)**, **Context Packs**, **autonomy ladders**, **Agent Scorecards**, **OKRs that stay tool‑agnostic**, and **Business Model Canvas** wired to **Cost per Outcome**.

Inside, you’ll get a practical operating system:
- Make **humans own outcomes**, agents do the busywork.  
- Design **agent portfolios** for your stage: Prototypes, Productize & Scale, Org‑Scale Platform.  
- Shift from meetings to **artifacts**: P→P→S, decision logs, C4 diagrams, runbooks.  
- Run **AgentOps**: registry, HITL, eval harness, promotion/demotion by evidence.  
- Track what matters: **tokens per task, autonomous accept rate, escalation/correction rates**, cost/latency/safety/drift.  
- Price and package by **outcome**, not tokens; show **cost savings** instead of “AI magic.”

Whether you’re an EM, PM, TL, Staff/Principal, or a founder building software with a small, senior team—this book helps you **manage agents like top performers** and **ship with taste**.

**Ideal reader:** Anyone in the delivery layer (EM/PM/Program) who knows that leveraging agents is really about **managing** them—and that classic engineering management skills transfer directly.
