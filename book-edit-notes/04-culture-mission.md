> **Author Intake (responses)**  
> • Culture is the ultimate operating system; in the AI era, magnitude and amplification are the difference.  
> • **Outcome Ownership** is the non‑negotiable: a human owns outcomes; agents may do work, but humans sign off.  
> • Delegate by granularity: humans own outcomes; humans own/approve large tasks; agents take smaller/mindless tasks.  
> • Taste, critique, and expertise are required; “general manager” abstraction gives way to craft leadership.  
> • Mission is unchanged; expectations rise because of new tools.  
> • Behaviors valuable for humans are identical for agents: clear goals, context, access to support, and guidance.  
> • Hiring and onboarding **AI agents** should be treated explicitly; gain C‑level mandate and cultural support to adopt.

## Culture Is the Operating System
Culture sets defaults for **how work is defined, delegated, reviewed, and improved**. In the **AI era**, the stakes are higher because you may run **thousands to millions of agents**. If your **operating instructions or North Star are off**, you **compound mistakes faster**. Culture must therefore be **explicit and operationalized**.

## The One Rule: Outcome Ownership
- **Human accountability is non‑transferable.** Agents may produce; humans must **sign off** before outcomes enter the ecosystem.  
- **Granularity ladder**:  
  - **Outcome** → Human owner (defines acceptance, metrics, and sign‑off).  
  - **Large tasks** → Human owned and **reviewed** (design, architecture, risky migrations).  
  - **Small/repetitive tasks** → Delegate to agents (scaffolding, lookups, drafts) behind **HITL** gates.  
- **Reason**: Prevents **error amplification** and ensures that taste and domain expertise remain the final filter.

## Taste and Craft Are Back at the Center
As you manage **human and artificial** agents, you need **taste**—the ability to **critique** and to tell *good* from *great*. That requires **expertise in what you own**. The abstract “general manager” model erodes; **craft leadership** (technical and product judgment) becomes decisive.

**Build taste by design**:  
- Review exemplars (“gold standard” libraries, PRs, docs).  
- Pair critique sessions (human ⇄ agent) with rubrics.  
- Keep a **decision log**: what we accepted and why.

## Mission: Unchanged, Expectations Elevated
Your mission doesn’t become “AI.” It remains **user value + business economics + safety**. What changes is your **expectation**: with today’s tools, you must **leverage** more, **instrument** more, and **ship** more responsibly.

**Mission framing** (concise template):  
> *For [user/outcome], we will deliver [measurable value] at [unit economics/SLOs], under [safety/compliance constraints], by orchestrating [humans + agents] with [clear acceptance tests & observability].*

## What Both Humans and Agents Need
- **Clear goals** — crisp acceptance criteria and success metrics.  
- **Context** — current, relevant sources with freshness SLAs.  
- **Access to support** — escalation paths, owners, runbooks.  
- **Guidance with autonomy** — constraints that guide *without over‑constraining improvement.*

## Cultural Behaviors (Make Them Explicit)
1. **No unreviewed agent output** reaches customer surfaces or production.  
2. **Document the “will/won’t do”** for every agent; publish boundaries and exit criteria.  
3. **Trace everything**: prompts, tool calls, versions, inputs/outputs (with PII controls).  
4. **Rubric‑based reviews**: quality bars are written, not implied.  
5. **Blameless & accountable PIRs**: fix systems, assign owners, update guardrails.  
6. **Docs‑as‑default**: decisions, acceptance tests, and runbooks live in the doc graph.  
7. **Least privilege by default**: model/tool allowlists; auditable credentials.

## Hiring & Onboarding — *For People and for Agents*
Treat agents as new teammates with an **onboarding plan**.

**Agent Hiring Packet (1‑pager)**  
- **Purpose**: problem to solve; intended use cases.  
- **Boundaries**: *will/won’t do*, risk classes, escalation.  
- **Inputs**: context sources, freshness, permissions.  
- **Tools**: allowed APIs/functions; rate limits; data policies.  
- **Acceptance**: golden datasets, eval thresholds, HITL gates.  
- **Owner & On‑call**: primary, backup, and contact channels.  
- **Rollback**: triggers and procedure.

**Agent Onboarding Checklist**  
- Create **MCP/registry** entry; assign identity & scopes.  
- Wire **eval harness** in CI; set pass/fail thresholds.  
- Enable **tracing** and **dashboards** (success/cost/latency/safety).  
- Add **policy tests** (PII, secrets, prompt/response).  
- Publish **runbook** and **RACI**; announce in Slack/Docs.  
- Schedule **30/60/90** reviews to graduate autonomy.

## Adoption Requires a Loud C‑Level Mandate
Executive sponsorship isn’t marketing—**it clears internal friction** about time, budget, and importance. The **CEO’s “AI‑first” message** is often aimed at the *inside* of the company: it grants permission and urgency to **experiment**, **instrument**, and **adopt**. Pair the mandate with:
- **Guardrails** (Non‑negotiables + policy tests).  
- **Time & budget** allocations for evals/observability.  
- **Portfolio reviews** to scale what works and kill what doesn’t.

## Outcome Ownership Maturity (Autonomy Ladder)
1. **Manual + HITL** — Agent drafts; human approves each change.  
2. **Scenario‑gated** — Auto‑approve within “safe” scenarios; HITL for others.  
3. **Metric‑gated** — Auto‑approve while metrics ≥ thresholds; rollback on regression.  
4. **Policy‑gated** — Auto‑approve with continuous policy tests and anomaly detection; periodic audits.

## Anti‑Patterns (Name and Eliminate)
- **Output dumping**: volume without ownership creates downstream burden and risk.  
- **No owner**: if everyone owns an agent, no one does.  
- **Politics over performance**: optics of “AI‑first” without evals, HITL, or rollback.  
- **Over‑constrained teams**: guidance that forbids improvement attempts.  
- **Generalism without craft**: leaders unable to critique cannot guarantee outcomes.

## Rituals That Make Culture Real
- **Daily** — 15‑minute AgentOps stand‑up: incidents, eval deltas, changes.  
- **Weekly** — Portfolio review: success/cost/latency/safety; scale/kill decisions.  
- **Monthly** — Policy & PIRs: close loops; update guardrails; refresh docs.  
- **Quarterly** — Autonomy audit: re‑assess ladders, permissions, owners.

## Summary
**Outcome Ownership** is the master key. With millions of potential agents, culture is how you avoid *amplifying mistakes*. Keep humans accountable for outcomes, delegate by granularity, and operationalize culture through **explicit behaviors, onboarding, and rituals**.

## Change Log
- 2025-10-06: New chapter draft for the agent era—Outcome Ownership, cultural behaviors, hiring/onboarding agents, C‑level mandate, autonomy ladder.
