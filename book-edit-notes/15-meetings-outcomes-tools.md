> **Author Intake (response)**  
> As teams get smaller and more effective with agents, **ceremonies can be collapsed**. Alignment and communication still matter, but **artifacts are more important than theater**. Agents must be able to **access artifacts** and **inject insights/data**—especially when they helped create those artifacts. **Eliminate meetings whenever possible.**

## Thesis
Meet only when the **artifact** can’t move the outcome forward on its own. The operating system is: **Outcome → Artifact → Tools → (Meeting if needed)**. Agents read/write the artifacts and supply **metrics, insights, and traces** so decisions can be made asynchronously.

---

## The Pipeline
```
Outcome (what we need) 
  → Artifact (what proves progress) 
  → Tools (where the artifact lives, how it stays fresh) 
  → Meeting? (only if async review can't decide)
```

### Artifact Types (Agent‑Ready by default)
- **P→P→S pack** (Purpose, Problems, Solutions) with **Acceptance Tests** (Ch.14)  
- **Decision log entry** (one decision per entry; immutable with append-only corrections)  
- **C4 diagram** at the right granularity  
- **Agent Design Brief** + **Context Packs** + **Eval harness** (Ch.07/14)  
- **Runbook & rollback** with on‑call/rules of engagement  
- **Agent Scorecards & dashboards** (Ch.13)

**Agent access**: read/write scopes, trace links, structured fields (YAML/JSON), TTL on context, and audit trails.

## Collapse the Ceremonies (Minimal Set)
### 1) **AgentOps Review** (keep; short)
- **When**: 15 minutes, daily or 3×/week.  
- **Inputs**: agent scorecards; eval deltas; incidents; cost/latency SLOs.  
- **Outputs**: autonomy changes, stabilization tasks, updated runbooks.  
- **Attendees**: KR owner + agent owner; others async via notes.

### 2) **Decision Review** (often async)
- **When**: on demand; **async-first** with 24‑hour comment window.  
- **Inputs**: single-page decision doc w/ options, acceptance, costs.  
- **Outputs**: decision log entry; action items with owners/dates.  
- **Meeting if**: unresolved blocking comments or cross‑team conflict.

### 3) **Design Critique** (time-boxed)
- **When**: 45–60 minutes, only when architecture changes risk.  
- **Inputs**: C4 + acceptance tests; agent implications.  
- **Outputs**: approved design deltas; risks; experiment plan.

### 4) **Post‑Incident Review (PIR)** (keep; sacred)
- **When**: within 5 business days of Sev1/Sev2.  
- **Inputs**: traces, timelines, contributing factors (human/agent).  
- **Outputs**: fixes, policy tests, documentation updates; owner & due dates.

### 5) **Portfolio Review** (short, weekly/biweekly)
- **When**: 30–45 minutes.  
- **Inputs**: OKRs/KRs, cost savings, scorecard roll‑ups.  
- **Outputs**: kill/scale decisions; budget shifts; roadmap notes.

> **Remove or merge** classic stand‑ups/status meetings unless they unblock decisions. Status lives in **dashboards and decision logs**.

---

## Async‑First Defaults (Make Meetings Rare)
- **Pre‑reads required** (5–10 minutes) with summary by an **agent**.  
- **Comment‑to‑decision** SLA (e.g., 24 hours) before scheduling.  
- **Auto‑generated minutes** by agents; push to doc graph; tag owners.  
- **Dory/agenda bot** collects questions; meeting closes when all answered.  
- **Invite rule**: if your name isn’t on an **owner** or **decision** line, you’re optional.

---

## Tooling Defaults (Outcome → Artifact → Tools)
- **Doc graph** (decision docs, P→P→S, runbooks, C4).  
- **Dashboards** (OKRs, scorecards, SLOs, cost).  
- **Trace capture** (prompts, tool calls, versions, I/O) with retention & PII controls.  
- **Decision log** (append-only; searchable).  
- **Notification routing** (triage windows; quiet hours; escalation policy).

Agents should **post pre-reads**, **summarize risks**, and **propose decisions** with links to traces and acceptance tests.

## Templates (Drop‑in)

### Decision Doc (1‑page)
```
Title: Decision about X
Outcome: What success unlocks
Options: A / B / C (with cost, risk, acceptance)
Agent Input: links to traces, eval deltas, cost/latency snapshots
Decision: Chosen option + why
Actions: owner, date, rollback plan
```

### Meeting Invite (auto‑generated by agent)
```
Purpose: Unblock [specific decision/outcome]
Pre‑read: link (summary by agent)
Attendees: Owner(s), Required reviewers, Optional readers
Agenda: 10m review, 15m discussion, 5m decisions
Exit: decision log entry + action items (auto-published)
```

### PIR Skeleton
```
Incident: Sev2 spike in import failures
What happened: timeline + traces
Why it happened: contributing factors (human/agent)
What we changed: fixes, policy tests, runbook updates
How we know: metrics moved; eval thresholds; regression guard
Owners & dates: accountable names, due dates
```

---

## Metrics (Signal > Theater)
- **Meeting hours/FTE** (target ↓)  
- **Async decisions %** (target ↑)  
- **Artifact freshness index** (target ↑)  
- **Time‑to‑decision** (target ↓)  
- **PIR action close rate** (target ≥ 90% in SLA)

---

## Anti‑Patterns
- **Slideware without artifacts**: no decision, no change.  
- **Tool‑led agenda**: picking tools before defining the artifact.  
- **Status theater**: meetings that recite dashboards.  
- **Agent‑blind meetings**: artifacts not readable by agents; no trace links.  
- **Invite sprawl**: more people than decisions.

---

## Summary
Shrink ceremonies; **elevate artifacts**. Let agents read/write those artifacts, inject insights, and keep them fresh. Meet only when async can’t decide. That’s how you keep alignment **and** velocity while your team and your agents do their best work.

## Change Log
- 2025-10-06: Reframed ceremonies as artifacts-first; added minimal meeting set, async defaults, tooling, templates, and metrics.
